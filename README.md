=========

The (free) app has been approved for posting on the [Amazon App Store](http://www.amazon.com/OKeez-GW2Events/dp/B00B53JEX0/)!

GW2Events is a free mobile app that lets gamers notify each other using a Twitter tag (#gw2events) as a notification channel. 

The app lets you configure which meta events you want to follow on which server(s) with simple switches. The initial version supports the most popular meta events, but other fun zone events and dungeon gatherings may be added later. Suggestions are welcome.

The app also has a quick tweet composer that automatically formats the tweet by using spinner lists with all events, statuses and servers. But Twitter users may also send messages from their web browser. If you follow the message tag format, your tweets will be featured in the message list, irrespective of whether they originate from the app or from a normal tweet.The selection shown on the left would translate into the following tweet:

`#gw2events #jormag is starting on #fissure_of_woe`

I will post a full listing of all event and server tags when the app is available for Android and iOS.

The message list will filter tweets according to your option filters. 

At his point, all tweets are preceded by the word TEST until I'm sure everything works as expected. 

An iOS version will be published once the Android version is running fine, as the approval process is a bit more involved for the apple App Store.
